  #  Python-code-1:
     function to iteratively sum up the value x**n/n! from n=1 to a given N for a given x , 
     i.e., F(x, n) = 1 + [\sum_{i = 1}^N (x**n/n!)]
    
  # Python-code-2:
    function to iteratively sum up the value x**n/n! from n=1 to a chosen value of N such that 
    F(x, N) - F(x, N-1) < ϵ for a given real number x, and positive small number ϵ.
    
  # Python-code-3:
    Create a list of 10 ordered pairs  (x,y),  x ϵ [−6,6]  such that they satisfy the equation  x2+y2=r2  where  r=6.
    
  # Python-code-4:
    We have a list of tuple representing the name and height (in cms) of 5 students respectively. Convert the list into 
    a dictionary so that we can access the student's height from their names.

    data = [('Sumit', 183), ('Rahul', 175), ('Kritika', 170), ('Harshit', 177), ('Deepak', 162)]
    
  # Python-code-5:
    Write a function which takes list of random integers as an input and returns the list all the unique values present 
    in that list. For ex:

     Input: [1, 2, 4, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 5, 3]
     Output : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
     
  # Python-code-6:
    Write a program to generate a dictionary that contains the number between  1  and  n  in the form of  (key:value)=(x:x2)  
    where  n=100 . For ex:
    If n = 7 then output will be = {0:0, 1:1, 2:4}
