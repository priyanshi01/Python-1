  #  Python-code-1:
     function to iteratively sum up the value x**n/n! from n=1 to a given N for a given x , 
     i.e., F(x, n) = 1 + [\sum_{i = 1}^N (x**n/n!)]
    
  # Python-code-2:
    function to iteratively sum up the value x**n/n! from n=1 to a chosen value of N such that 
    F(x, N) - F(x, N-1) < e (represent epsilon, i.e., any smaller value) for a given real 
    number x, and positive small number e
